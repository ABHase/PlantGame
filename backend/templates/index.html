        <p>
            While we're watering and nurturing this little game plant of ours, the soil might get tilled from time to time. That means all your progress could magically return to seed form (a.k.a. poof! gone). But hey, there is a time to reap and a time to sow. So, if you're cool with that, let's get planting!
